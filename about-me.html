            <p>I wrote this at a moment when I was feeling very low and lost.</p>
            <p>It was frustrating to think that after all the personal growth I had achieved I still felt disconnected.</p>
            <p>Upon sitting with this feeling...</p>
            <p>I realized I knew who I was, more importantly who I want to be.</p>
            <p>It was just the current state I was in that was creating this foggy scene.</p>
            <p>So I decided to write some of those things in my journal, most I share with you here.</p>
            <p>It has been of great value to me.</p> 
            <p>Undeniably, we all live in constant highs and lows, and the act of writing down who I know I am and who I choose to be </p>
                <p>has given me a great tool to come back to whenever I am feeling unsettled and rootless.</p>
